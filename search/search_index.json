A JWT token will be assigned to the client after the login request, the token is persistent unless the user log out manually. The token will be stored in the database, up to 2 tokens can be generated, thus it means the user can sign in to 2 different devices (e.g. web and mobile) at the same time. If additional device is logged in, the oldest token will be automatically invalidated, thus the first device would be automatically logged out. The user can access logout-all endpoint to invalidate all tokens at once, achieving logging out of all devices. The client application should be able to handle the invalid token. That's to say, when any request that requires authorization returned 401 Unauthorized , the app should immediately abandon any further request and perform logout on the device, then prompt the user to log in again.

Install Homebrew \u00b6 OSX does not include the Homebrew brew package by default. Install brew using the official instructions . Tap the MongoDB Homebrew Tap \u00b6 Issue the following from the terminal to tap the official MongoDB Homebrew Tap : brew tap mongodb/brew Procedure \u00b6 Follow these steps to install MongoDB Community Edition using the third-party brew package manager. From a terminal, issue the following: brew install mongodb-community@4.2 Run MongoDB Community Edition \u00b6 Follow these steps to run MongoDB Community Edition. These instructions assume that you are using the default settings. You can run MongoDB as a macOS service using brew, or you can run MongoDB manually as a background process. It is recommended to run MongoDB as a macOS service, as doing so sets the correct system ulimit values automatically (see ulimit settings for more information). To run MongoDB (i.e. the mongod process) as a macOS service, issue the following: brew services start mongodb-community@4.2 To run MongoDB manually as a background process, issue the following: mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf --fork Both methods use the /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf file created during the install. You can add your own MongoDB configuration options to this file as well. To verify that MongoDB is running, search for mongod in your running processes: ps aux | grep -v grep | grep mongod You can also view the log file to see the current status of your mongod process: /usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log. Connect and Use MongoDB \u00b6 To begin using MongoDB, connect a mongo shell to the running instance. From a new terminal, issue the following: mongo ref: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/ Windows \u00b6 Install MongoDB Community Edition \u00b6 Prerequisites \u00b6 Users on Windows versions previous to Windows 10 must install the following update before installing MongoDB: Update for Universal C Runtime for Windows Users on Windows 10, Server 2016 and Server 2019 do not need this update. Procedure \u00b6 Follow these steps to install MongoDB Community Edition using the MongoDB Installer wizard. The installation process installs both the MongoDB binaries as well as the default configuration file \\ \\bin\\mongod.cfg. Download MongoDB Community Edition. Download the installer (.msi) from the MongoDB Download Center : The Download Center should display MongoDB Community Server download information. If not, select Server , then click the MongoDB Community Server tab. In the Version dropdown, select the version that corresponds to the latest MongoDB Server 4.2. In the OS dropdown, Windows 64-bit X64 should be selected. In the Package drop down, MSI should be selected. Click Download . Run the MongoDB installer. For example, from the Windows Explorer/File Explorer: Go to the directory where you downloaded the MongoDB installer ( .msi file). By default, this is your Downloads directory. Double-click the .msi file. Follow the MongoDB Community Edition installation wizard. The wizard steps you through the installation of MongoDB and MongoDB Compass. a. Choose Setup Type \u00b6 You can choose either the Complete (recommended for most users) or Custom setup type. The Complete setup option installs MongoDB and the MongoDB tools to the default location. The Custom setup option allows you to specify which executables are installed and where. b. Service Configuration \u00b6 Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can set up MongoDB as a Windows service during the install or just install the binaries. MongoDB Service MongoDB MongoDB Service \u00b6 The following installs and configures MongoDB as a Windows service. Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can configure and start MongoDB as a Windows service during the install, and the MongoDB service is started upon successful installation. Select Install MongoD as a Service MongoDB as a service. Select either: Run the service as Network Service user (Default) This is a Windows user account that is built-in to Windows or Run the service as a local or domain user For an existing local user account, specify a period (i.e. .) for the Account Domain and specify the Account Name and the Account Password for the user. For an existing domain user, specify the Account Domain , the Account Name and the Account Password for that user. Service Name . Specify the service name. Default name is MongoDB . If you already have a service with the specified name, you must choose another name. Data Directory . Specify the data directory, which corresponds to the --dbpath . If the directory does not exist, the installer will create the directory and sets the directory access to the service user. Log Directory . Specify the Log directory, which corresponds to the --logpath. If the directory does not exist, the installer will create the directory and sets the directory access to the service user. MongoDB \u00b6 The following installs MongoDB only and does not configure MongoDB as a Windows service. If you choose not to configure MongoDB as a Windows service, uncheck the Install MongoD as a Service . c. Install MongoDB Compass \u00b6 For Windows 8 or greater, you can have the wizard install MongoDB Compass . To install Compass, select Install MongoDB Compass (Default). d. When ready, click Install. \u00b6 If You Installed MongoDB as a Windows Service \u00b6 The MongoDB service is started upon successful installation To begin using MongoDB, connect a mongo.exe shell to the running MongoDB instance. Either: From Windows Explorer/File Explorer, go to C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Server\\4.2\\bin\\ directory and double-click on mongo.exe. Or, open a Command Interpreter with Administrative privileges and run: C: \\P rogram Files \\M ongoDB \\S erver \\4 .2 \\b in \\m ongo.exe If You Did Not Install MongoDB as a Windows Service \u00b6 If you only installed the executables and did not install MongoDB as a Windows service, you must manually start the MongoDB instance. See Run MongoDB Community Edition from the Command Interpreter for instructions to start a MongoDB instance. Run MongoDB Community Edition as a Windows Service \u00b6 Starting in version 4.0, you can install and configure MongoDB as a Windows Service during the install, and the MongoDB service is started upon successful installation.

Right-click on the MongoDB service and click Start . To begin using MongoDB, connect a mongo.exe shell to the running MongoDB instance. To connect, open a Command Interpreter with Administrative privileges and run: C: \\P rogram Files \\M ongoDB \\S erver \\4 .2 \\b in \\m ongo.exe Stop MongoDB Community Edition as a Windows Service \u00b6 To stop/pause the MongoDB service, use the Services console: From the Services console, locate the MongoDB service. Right-click on the MongoDB service and click Stop (or Pause ). Remove MongoDB Community Edition as a Windows Service \u00b6 To remove the MongoDB service, first use the Services console to stop the service. Then open a Windows command prompt/interpreter ( cmd.exe ) as an Administrator , and run the following command: sc.exe delete MongoDB Run MongoDB Community Edition from the Command Interpreter \u00b6 You can run MongoDB Community Edition from the Windows command prompt/interpreter ( cmd.exe ) instead of as a service. Open a Windows command prompt/interpreter ( cmd.exe ){target=_blank} as an Administrator . 1. Create database directory. \u00b6 Create the data directory where MongoDB stores data. MongoDB\u2019s default data directory path is the absolute path \\data\\db on the drive from which you start MongoDB. From the Command Interpreter , create the data directories: cd C: \\ md \"\\data\\db\" 2. Start your MongoDB database. \u00b6 To start MongoDB, run mongod.exe . \"C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Server\\4.2\\bin\\mongod.exe\" --dbpath = \"c:\\data\\db\" The --dbpath option points to your database directory. If the MongoDB database server is running correctly, the Command Interpreter displays: [initandlisten] waiting for connections 3.
