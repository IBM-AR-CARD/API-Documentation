!!! warning
    Please correctly config the Watson Assistant, and paste the correct `WATSON_KEY` and `WATSON_ASSISTANT_ID` into the `.env` file. We have attached our Watson Config Key and ID into the submission.

    Please also note that `UPLOAD_FOLDER` should be publically accessible.

    `SERVER_ADDRESS` should be the root URL of the server, `JWT_KEY` can be any arbitrary key for encryption.

## Run the application

Make sure:

- Your current directory is the backend working directory.
- MongoDB is correctly installed.
- You have run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- Your `.env` is correctly configured.

Run:

```bash
node server.js
```

to start the server, once the server has started you will see similar output:

```bash
App listening on port ${port}!
```

You can also use a process manager such as `pm2` to run the server persistantly.

If you have pm2 installed, you can also use our launch script: 


```bash
./launch.sh 
```
